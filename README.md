# Protein-Sequence-Prediction
Multilabel classification of protein sequence using word splitting
Understanding the role of different protein sequences in our life is very difficult using traditional method. 
This project operates on a method which converts the protein function prediction problem to a language translation problem and
applies a LSTM based neural machine translation model for protein function prediction.For biological processes I developed a new
language of Protein sequence known as ProLan, from the dataset and applied a depth-first search, to convert it into GoLan.
From this, a model is trained which is capable of predicting the biological functions of protein using multilabel classification.
Based on keras, Deep Learning, a library of python.
